# Go Katas
I always struggle to think of meaningful project ideas to flex my skills. Usually I end up implementing
some sort of game/game engine but these projects are usually too large to find the time to complete. Recently
I have been looking for something to help me explore Go. I figured that doing a bunch of kata style projects 
would be an interesting way to hone my skills and explore Go a bit more. With each kata being fairly small 
it is easier to to find the time to do them around work and life commitments.

This repository is made up of multiple sub-projects that each implement a specific challenge. Each will be
complemented by a suite of tests indicating the desired behavior of each challenge.

Below you can find links to each kata and a brief description of what it entails. As the list grows, I might 
end up breaking them down into categories and re structure the repository.

## Implemented

### Karate Chop
[CodeKata Kata02: Karate Chop](http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/) - Dave Thomas

Implement five different versions of a binary search algorithm that takes an integer search target and a sorted
array of integers. It should return the integer index of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not
in the array.

* Implemented an iterative binary search satisfying the given test cases + benchmarks.
